# flamework-api-only

This is a work in progress!

This is an attempt to build an API based on [flamework](http://github.com/cooperhewitt/flamework) and these [flamework-api](http://github.com/cooperhewitt/flamework-api) drop in libraries. The idea being to remove all unnecessary code, and the entire web based user-interface (api docs).

More soon.
